# Game Ideas

## Ideas for game mechanics

- Make challenges for each section of the resume
- Have minimalist graphics for the game
- Use pop-up screens to display resume contents
- Make resume contents be accessible in treasures or some sort of container when the player completes a challenge.
  Alternatively, we could make the sections of the resume be pieces of a document that are collected at the end of a challenge and the player gets to read the entire thing in the end. Maybe even add a riddle to unlock the end of the game.
- The perspective of the person playing the game will be that of an interviewer, therefore, the game should provide info about the character instead of making the person playing the game feel as if the character is him/her. In other words, make the person playing feel as if he/she is helping the character pass the challenges.

## Challenges (Resume Sections)

### Education Section

- Make player enter a maze and collect a homework paper and deposit it in a bin to unlock the next level

### Work Experience Section

- Drive to workplace. Once you get to the workplace display when you arrived and make a transition to display until when you stopped working at the place. Repeat this for all jobs you've had. The driving of the car can be a challenge (eg: evade obstacles, obstacles can be 3 or vary depending on the number of jobs, more jobs = less obstacles)

### Technical Experience

### Extracurricular Activities
